# Indonesia-IDX30-Stock-Return-Panel-Regression

Analyzed multi-year panel data of 29 Indonesian companies to study stock return behavior. Applied Pooled OLS, Fixed Effect, and Random Effect models, supported by full econometric diagnostics. Identified key factors (volatility & market return) that significantly drive firm-level stock returns. 

Results:
1. Volatility and market return were the most significant predictors of stock return across firms.
2. FE model showed meaningful differences between individual entities, proving that unit-level uniqueness matters.
3. Model explained major variation across companies more accurately than pooled OLS.
